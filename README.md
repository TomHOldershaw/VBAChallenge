stockmarket_array_1.1.vb : stockmarket script using arrays

Note: both scripts produce identical outputs. Rubric for "Retrieval of Data" states "reads/stores all of the following values from each row". Only the _no_array script meets this criteron, as the array script takes a different approach.
Homework image submission is based on the _no_array script
